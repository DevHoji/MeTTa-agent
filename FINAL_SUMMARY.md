# Ethiopian Recipe Recommendation Agent - Final Clean Project üá™üáπ

## üéØ Project Overview

You now have a **clean, professional Ethiopian Recipe Recommendation Agent** that implements **symbolic cognitive architecture** with **backward chaining** reasoning. The agent can answer complex questions about Ethiopian cuisine by reasoning through multiple steps, even when answers aren't directly stored in the knowledge base.

## üìÅ Clean Project Structure

### Core Files (4 files):
1. **`knowledge_base.metta`** - Facts about Ethiopian ingredients and recipes (doro, berbere, injera, etc.)
2. **`rules.metta`** - Logical reasoning rules for Ethiopian cuisine
3. **`agent.metta`** - Advanced cognitive functions for Ethiopian recipe analysis
4. **`ask_questions.metta`** - Where you test the Ethiopian recipe agent

### Documentation Files:
5. **`questions_list.md`** - All Ethiopian recipe questions you can ask (copy from here)
6. **`project_explanation.md`** - Detailed technical explanation
7. **`FINAL_SUMMARY.md`** - This summary
8. **`HOW_TO_USE.md`** - Step-by-step usage guide

## üöÄ How to Test Your Ethiopian Recipe Agent

### Step 1: Load the Agent
```bash
metta ask_questions.metta
```
**Expected output**: Silent loading (just empty brackets `[()]`)

### Step 2: Ask Ethiopian Recipe Questions
1. **Open**: `ask_questions.metta`
2. **Copy**: Any Ethiopian recipe question from `questions_list.md`
3. **Paste**: In the "YOUR QUESTION GOES HERE" section
4. **Run**: `metta ask_questions.metta`
5. **See**: Proof-based answer!

### Example Test:
1. Copy this question:
```metta
!(syn &kb (fromNumber 4) (: $proof (CanMake chicken_stirfry)))
```

2. Paste it in `ask_questions.metta`:
```metta
;; YOUR QUESTION GOES HERE:
!(syn &kb (fromNumber 4) (: $proof (CanMake chicken_stirfry)))
```

3. Run: `metta ask_questions.metta`

4. Expected result:
```
[(syn &kb (fromNumber 4) (: $proof (CanMake chicken_stirfry)))]
```

```

## üß† How the Agent Reasons (Example)

### Question: "What can Alice (vegetarian) make?"
**Query**: `!(syn &kb (fromNumber 5) (: $proof (RecommendFor $recipe alice)))`

### Agent's Reasoning Process:
1. **Goal**: Find recipes to recommend for Alice
2. **Rule Found**: `vegetarian-recommendation-rule`
   - Needs: Alice is vegetarian AND recipe is vegetarian AND we can make it
3. **Check Alice**: `(IsVegetarian alice)` ‚úì (direct fact)
4. **Find Vegetarian Recipes**: Apply `vegetarian-recipe-rule`
   - Check if recipe ingredients are vegetarian
   - `tofu_scramble`: tofu, spinach, mushroom all vegetarian ‚úì
   - `pasta_dish`: pasta, tomato, onion all vegetarian ‚úì
5. **Check Availability**: Apply `recipe-possible-rule`
   - We have tofu, spinach, mushroom ‚úì
   - We have pasta, tomato, onion ‚úì
6. **Result**: Recommend both recipes with complete proof chain

### Proof Output Format:
```
(: ((rule1 fact1) (rule2 fact2)) (Conclusion))
```
This shows: Used rule1 with fact1, then rule2 with fact2 to reach conclusion.

## üéØ Questions That Demonstrate Reasoning (Not Direct Facts)

These questions show the agent's reasoning power:

### 1. Multi-constraint reasoning:
```metta
!(syn &kb (fromNumber 6) (: $proof (RecommendFor $recipe alice)))
```
**Reasoning**: Alice is vegetarian ‚Üí Find vegetarian recipes ‚Üí Check availability ‚Üí Recommend

### 2. Recipe classification:
```metta
!(syn &kb (fromNumber 4) (: $proof (IsVegetarianRecipe pasta_dish)))
```
**Reasoning**: What ingredients does pasta need ‚Üí Are they vegetarian ‚Üí Therefore recipe is vegetarian

### 3. Ingredient categorization:
```metta
!(syn &kb (fromNumber 4) (: $proof (CanMakeProteinDish $ingredient)))
```
**Reasoning**: What ingredients are proteins ‚Üí Do we have them ‚Üí Can make protein dishes

## üîç Understanding Results

### Simple Result:
```
(: rule-name (Conclusion))
```
**Meaning**: Used one rule to reach conclusion

### Complex Result:
```
(: ((rule1 fact1) rule2) (Conclusion))
```
**Meaning**: Used rule1 with fact1, then rule2 to reach conclusion

### Multiple Results:
```
[(: proof1 conclusion1), (: proof2 conclusion2)]
```
**Meaning**: Multiple ways to reach conclusions or multiple valid answers

## ‚úÖ Project Features Demonstrated

- Rule-based reasoning (like ACT-R)
- Goal-directed search (like Soar)
- Declarative vs procedural knowledge separation

### 2. Backward Chaining:
- Starts with goals, works backward to facts
- Constructs complete proof chains
- Shows reasoning transparency

### 3. Multi-Step Reasoning:
- Chains multiple rules together
- Handles complex constraints
- Simulates human-like reasoning

### 4. Explainable AI:
- Every answer comes with proof
- Shows complete reasoning trace
- Enables trust and debugging

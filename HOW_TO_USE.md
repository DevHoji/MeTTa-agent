Open `questions_list.md` and copy any question you want to ask.

### Step 2: Ask the Question
1. Open `ask_questions.metta`
2. Find line 120: `!(syn &kb (fromNumber 4) (: $proof (CanMake chicken_stirfry)))`
3. Replace it with your chosen question
4. Save the file

### Step 3: Get the Answer
Run: `metta ask_questions.metta`

## üìã Example Usage

### Example 1: Basic Recipe Question
**Question**: Can we make chicken stir fry?
**Code**: `!(syn &kb (fromNumber 4) (: $proof (CanMake chicken_stirfry)))`
**Result**: `[(: ((recipe-possible-rule stirfry-chicken) available-chicken) (CanMake chicken_stirfry))]`
**Meaning**: "Yes, we can make chicken stir fry because we have chicken and the recipe requires chicken"

### Example 2: Dietary Restriction Question
**Question**: What can Alice (vegetarian) make?
**Code**: `!(syn &kb (fromNumber 5) (: $proof (RecommendFor $recipe alice)))`
**Result**: Multiple complex proofs showing vegetarian recipes
**Meaning**: "Alice can make tofu scramble and pasta dish because they use only vegetarian ingredients"

### Example 3: Nutritional Question
**Question**: What high-protein recipes can Bob make?
**Code**: `!(syn &kb (fromNumber 5) (: $proof (RecommendFor $recipe bob)))`
**Result**: Proofs showing high-protein recipes Bob can make
**Meaning**: "Bob can make chicken stir fry and tofu scramble because they're high in protein"

## üîç Understanding Results

```
**Meaning**: Used one rule to reach the conclusion

### Complex Proof:
```
(: ((rule1 fact1) rule2) (Conclusion))
```

## üß† How the Agent Reasons

The agent uses **backward chaining**:
1. **Starts** with your question (goal)
2. **Finds** rules that could prove the goal
3. **Recursively** proves the rule's prerequisites
4. **Constructs** a complete proof chain
5. **Returns** the proof showing how it reached the conclusion
